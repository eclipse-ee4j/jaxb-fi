<center><b>FastInfoset (FI) Samples</b></center>
<br><br>
Listed here are a few samples demonstrating the FastInfoset implementation of SAX and StAX. 
To try out the samples, please follow the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Get FastInfoset source and build the package. A FastInfoset.jar will be generated 
under &lt;FastInfoset home&gt;/dist.  The Ant tasks for the samples have dependency on 
the jar file.</li>
<li> Get the source and data files for the samples. Make sure to check out the whole samples package. All 
sources are under /src directory and XML files used in the samples are under /data directory.
</li>
<li> To run a sample, go to the samples directory and type ant &lt;target&gt;</li>
</ol>

<tr><th>Category</th><th>Samples (and Ant target)</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td rowspan=2>SAX</td>
    <td>SAXParsingSample</td>
    <td>The sample parses data/inv1a.finf as specified in the build.xml and handle SAX events 
        to display corresponding XML content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>SAXSerializingSample</td>
    <td>Directly using the FastInfoset SAX Serializer, the sample writes a small piece of XML 
        infoset taken from inv1a.xml into a 
        FastInfoset file called data/inv1c.finf. For details of the XML infoset, please refer to 
        <a href="dist/javadoc/index.html">samples JavaDoc</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td rowspan=3>StAX</td>
    <td>StAXEventReadingSample</td>
    <td>Demonstrate the use of FI StAX EventReader to read FI and XML files. The sample
        reads data/inv1a.xml and data/inv1a.finf and displays event types as it goes through
        the documents.<br>
        To try the sample with other xml files, edit the build.xml and change the "simple-xml-file" and 
         "simple-finf-file" properties to point to the files you may want to test.

<tr>
    <td>StAXParsingSample</td>
    <td>Demonstrate the use of FI StAX StreamReader to read FI files. The sample reads 
        data/inv1.finf and displays contents as it goes through the document.<br>
    
        Similar to the above EventReader, if you want to run the sample on other files, you would need to
        change the "simple-xml-file" and "simple-finf-file" properties to point to the files you may want to test. 
        The finf file specified will be generated automatically.

<tr><td rowspan=2>Transform</td>
    <td>XMLToFastInfosetSAXSerializer</td>
    <td>The sample demonstrates how to use SAXDocumentSerializer as a SAX handler and JAXP
        transformer to convert an XML file into a FI document. As shown in the sample, 
        transforming a DOM source to SAX Result involves very little coding. However, the process
        may not be efficient due to the construction of DOM source.

    <td>PrimitiveTypesWithElementContentSample</td>
    <td>The sample demonstrates how to use the SAX serializers/parsers to encode and
        decode type primitive data that is element content. The typed data,
        represented as Java primitive types, is encoded into the FI document in 
        efficient binary form and may be decoded into the same Java primitive types,
        or into lexical values (which depending on the handlers that are registered 
        with the SAX parser.
