<p>The Fast Infoset specification (ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1) describes an open, standards-based "binary XML" format that is based on the XML Information Set [XML Information Set]. JWSDP 1.6 now supports this optimized encoding as part of JAX-RPC 1.1.3. For ease of deployment, this new version of JAX-RPC also supports a form of HTTP content negotiation that can be used to "turn on" Fast Infoset during message exchanges. By default, the Fast Infoset encoding is turned off.  To see how to turn the Fast Infoset encoding on, and learn more about Fast Infoset, see the following documentation, which is included in Java WSDP 1.6:</p>
